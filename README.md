# cppBeginner
my first simple program to memorize my high school life

The first time I try to write a program to do something fun!
I know the program is naive and simple. I even didn't understand how to upload a cpp program to github at that time.
However, I decide to retain the program in memory of the beginning of my tour in computer world.

I really love a poem *Stopping　by　Woods　on　a　Snowy　Evening* by RobertFrost.

**The woods are lovely, dark, and deep
But I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep
And miles to go before I sleep**

The tour is lovely, hard, and mysterious.
Miles to go before I sleep.
